The aim of this project is to design and develop a digital thermometer using the 8051 microcontroller. The thermometer will measure ambient temperature using an LM35 temperature sensor and display the temperature reading on an LCD display. The 8051 microcontroller will read the analog output voltage from the LM35 sensor through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), process the data to calculate the corresponding temperature value, and then output the temperature to the LCD display using appropriate interfacing.
